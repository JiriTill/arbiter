# Future Improvement Plan for Arbiter

Based on the current state of the application and the goal of creating a "premium, trust-inspiring" experience, here is the roadmap for the next phases of development.

## Phase 6: Landing Page & Source Polish ✨
**Goal:** Make the first impression (Landing) and the deep-dive (Source) "WOW" the user.

1.  **Landing Page Revamp**:
    *   **Dynamic Hero**: Add a typing effect for the headline questions (e.g., *"Can I trade..."*).
    *   **Verdict Showcase**: Add a carousel of high-quality `VerdictCard` examples to show off the core value proposition immediately.
    *   **Visual Enhancements**: Replace the game initials with richer game "box" visuals or illustrations.
2.  **Source Page Polish**:
    *   Review `PDFViewer` to ensure it looks modern (dark mode support for PDF wrapper).
    *   Highlighting: Ensure the citation highlights are visible and auto-scroll correctly.

## Phase 7: Profile & Settings ⚙️
**Goal:** Make the app feel like a complete product with user personalization.

1.  **Settings Page**:
    *   **Theme Toggle**: Explicit Dark/Light/System switch.
    *   **Accessibility**: Text size slider.
2.  **"My Rulebooks" Mockup**:
    *   Create a "Request Game" or "Upload PDF" placeholder flow to engage users.
3.  **About Page**:
    *   Add a simple, clean page explaining "How it works" detail to build trust.

## Phase 8: Mobile UX Refinements 📱
**Goal:** Native-app feel on web.

1.  **Navigation**: Ensure the bottom nav hides/shows intelligently or sits perfectly on all devices (iPhone notch handling).
2.  **Gestures**: Add swipe actions for history items (e.g., swipe left to delete).
3.  **PWA**: Configure `manifest.json` so users can add it to their home screen with a proper icon and name.

## Phase 9: Feedback Loop 🔄
**Goal:** Improve answer quality over time.

1.  **Inline Feedback**: Move the thumb buttons directly into the `VerdictCard` footer for easier access.
2.  **Report Logic**: Create a formalized "Report Issue" flow for bad answers.

**Recommendation:** Start with **Phase 6** to maximize the visual impact for new users.
